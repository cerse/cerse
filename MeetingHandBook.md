## Overview

This document offers some guidance on how to go about
arranging a Community of Edinburgh Research Software 
Engineers (CERSE) meeting. This is an evolving document - if you have somthing to add please contribute.

## Infrastructure

We have some infrastructure set up to help organise 
meetings:

* [CIRSE GitHub Organisational account](https://github.com/cerse/) - to join this send your GitHub id to [mario](mailto:mario@epcc.ed.ac.uk?subject=Add me to the CERSE GitHub org.) or one of the other admins.
* [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cerse7)
* [JISC mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=ED-RSE-COMMUNITY)
* Slack channel - you will have to join the [UK RSE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9LqOWGwA1xDvSgy81eimcb9s0cNBFso0zv0_HoZz16G1M5w/viewform?c=0&w=1) slack and then join the `#edinbugh` channel.

## Process

### Before the event
This starts from the premis that a suitable venue has been booked for this event.

Before you can do anything you need to get yourself added to the GitHub Organisational Repositories. I am assuming that you are going to be coordinating a future CERSE meeting in Edinburgh. We are using GitHub io pages to publicise the meetings so it is important that you have a GitHub id with sufficient privileges.

1. Create a repository with a name like `yyyy-mm-dd-venue` for your meeting
2. Go into your repository and click on `Settings` (has a Gear wheel). 
  * Scroll down this page until you come to the `GitHub Pages` section.
  * Change the `Source` to `master branch`.
  * It will tell you where your repository is going to be published. It will have the pattern: `https://cerse.github.io/YourRepoName`. Take a copy of this (it will make your life easier later).
  * For the `Theme Chooser`, click on the `Change Theme`. We have been using the `Midnight theme` but if you think there is a better one for your event use that instead.
  * Go back to your repo page.
3. Click on the `Edit` button to modify the message `No description, website, or topics provided.`. Add a short description for your event but more importantly add the GitHub io pages website. This will save you lots of time later when you want to view the website.
4. Create a `Readme.md` file. Populate with the contents of a previous event. Edit according to the contents required for your event.
5. Go to the [cerse.github.io](https://github.com/cerse/cerse.github.io) repository which contains the master pages for the organisation. Add your event, in reverse chronological order, to the list of existing events. Make sure you point to the GitHub io pages and not the repository. 
6. It can be useful to set-up a registration process to know how many people are coming to the event (especially if catering is being provided). You could use:
   * [Edinburgh University events booking](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/comms-and-collab/event-booking) - make sure that externals to Edinburgh University can register for the event.
   * [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/)

### Lead up to the event

Advertise, advertise, advertise - hopefully, you can get some advice on good channels from existing member to do this.

### After the event

Make sure that you get permission from the participants that it is ok to add their presentations on-line and add these to your event repository.
