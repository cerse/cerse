## Accessibility statement for the Community of Edinburgh Research Software Engineering (CERSE) pages

Within the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk) and [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) we feel that inclusivity is important and acccessibility forms an important aspect of this. We will do our best to comply with the [Public Sector Body (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made)  legislation but if you find parts of this website that are not accessible to you then please email [m.antonioletti@epcc.ed.ac.uk](mailto:m.antonioletti@epcc.ed.ac.uk) and I will endevour to fix these problems.

This website and the individual meeting pages (which we call CERSEWeb) is run by a volunteer group mostly from the University of Edinburgh. You can view this website either as processed HTML generated from markdown or you may choose to view it via the original markdownin the GitHub (Click on the `View On GitHub` at the top and that will take you to the markdown). 

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of VoiceOver)

We run the resulting web pages through the following accessiblity checkers [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) and [AChecker](https://achecker.ca/) and try to fix any resulting problems. We have also tried to made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
