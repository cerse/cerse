## Accessibility statement for the Community of Edinburgh Research Software Engineering (CERSE) pages

This accessibility statement applies to the websites related to the Community of Edinburgh Research Software Engineering (CERSE), including the main website at [cerse.github.io/](https://cerse.github.io/) and the individual websites for each meeting. These websites are run by volunteers mainly from [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk).  


We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of VoiceOver)

We have also tried to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
