## Overview

This document offers some guidance on how to go about
arranging a Community of *Edinburgh Research Software 
Engineers* (CERSE) meeting. This is an evolving document - if you have something to add please contribute.

## Infrastructure

We have some infrastructure set up to help organise 
meetings:

* [CERSE GitHub Organisational account](https://github.com/cerse/) - to join this send your GitHub id to [mario](mailto:mario@epcc.ed.ac.uk?subject=Add me to the CERSE GitHub org.) or one of the other admins.
* [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cerse7)
* [JISC mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=ED-RSE-COMMUNITY)
* Slack channel - you will have to join the [UK RSE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9LqOWGwA1xDvSgy81eimcb9s0cNBFso0zv0_HoZz16G1M5w/viewform?c=0&w=1) slack and then join the `#edinburgh` channel.

## Process

### Venue requirements

A good venue should have:

* Capacity for up to around 50 people (registrations vary depending on time, day and location)
* RSEs tend to carry laptops around so have an adequate number of power sockets and/or power extensions available
* Have sufficient space or areas where break-out groups can interact without affecting the other breakout groups
* Have a projector at the front with a screen or other equipment that allows content to be projected

The venue should be available for around two hours.

### Before the event
This starts from the premise that a suitable venue has been booked for this event.

Before you can do anything you need to get yourself added to the GitHub Organisational Repositories. I am assuming that you are going to be coordinating a future CERSE meeting in Edinburgh. We use GitHub.io pages to publicise the meetings and log any outcomes so it is important that you have a GitHub id with sufficient privileges to do this.

1. Create a repository with a name that uses the `yyyy-mm-dd-venue` pattern for your meeting.
2. Go into your repository and click on `Settings` (has a Gear wheel). 
  * Scroll down this page until you come to the `GitHub Pages` section.
  * Change the `Source` to `master branch` (your io pages will be generated from your [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) pages in the repo starting from a `Readme.md` file).
  * Once you have done this GitHub will tell you where your GitHub io pages are going to be published. It will have the pattern: `https://cerse.github.io/YourRepoName`. Take a copy of this (it will make your life easier later).
  * For the `Theme Chooser`, click on the `Change Theme`. We have been using the `Midnight theme` but if you think there is a better one for your event use that instead.
  * Go back to your repo page.
3. Click on the `Edit` button to modify the message `No description, website, or topics provided.`. If you do not see this button ask for your privileges to be escalated. Add a short description for your event but more importantly add the GitHub io pages website. This will save you lots of time later when you want to view the website.
4. Create a `Readme.md` file. Populate with the contents of a previous event. Edit according to the contents required for your event.
5. Go to the [cerse.github.io](https://github.com/cerse/cerse.github.io) repository which contains the master pages for the organisation. Add your event, in reverse chronological order, to the list of existing events. Make sure you point to the GitHub io pages and not the repository. 
6. It can be useful to set-up a registration process to know how many people are coming to the event (especially if catering is being provided) and to generate an attendee list. For this you could use:
   * [Edinburgh University events booking](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/comms-and-collab/event-booking) - make sure that externals to Edinburgh University can register for the event.
   * [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/)

### Lead up to the event

Advertise, advertise, advertise - hopefully, you can get some advice on good channels from existing member to do this.

### On the day

For the day you will need:

* Signage and some non-damaging way to stick your signs if the room is difficult to find.
* A sign up sheet (with a pen) if you set up a registration process (good to know who actually turned up on the day and also those that did not register) so add a couple of extra blank rows for those that wish to sign up on the day. 

### After the event

Make sure that you have copies of any material that was presented and that you have permission from the content providers that it is ok to add their content online through your event repository. 

### Timeline

At the third CERSE meeting it was thought that having a bimonthly meeting might work best. This section attempts to give a suggested timeline on how to proceed. We are going to start from an assumption that the venue for the next CERSE meeting is decided on or soon after one of these meetings.
