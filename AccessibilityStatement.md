- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of VoiceOver)

We run the resulting web pages through the following accessiblity checkers [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) and [AChecker](https://achecker.ca/) and try to fix any resulting problems. We have also tried to made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
